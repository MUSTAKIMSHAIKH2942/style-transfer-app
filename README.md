# 🎨 Artistic Neural Style Transfer Web App

## Project Overview

This project is an **Artistic Neural Style Transfer Web Application**, built using a **pre-trained VGG19 Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.  
The app allows users to upload a **content image** and a **style image**, and then produces a new image that retains the content of the first image but adopts the artistic style of the second image.

This is a complete end-to-end **Machine Learning + Web Application project**, which I built to strengthen my knowledge of:

✅ Deep Learning  
✅ Neural Style Transfer  
✅ PyTorch Framework  
✅ Flask Web Framework  
✅ Deployment & MLOps basics  
✅ Building User Interfaces for ML Models  

---

## Technologies Used

- 🐍 Python 3.10  
- 🔥 PyTorch (VGG19, Neural Networks)  
- 🖼️ Pillow (PIL)  
- Flask (Web framework for building API & UI)  
- HTML / CSS (Simple UI)  

---

## How It Works

1️⃣ The user uploads:
- A **content image** → the structure to preserve  
- A **style image** → the texture, color, and style to apply  

2️⃣ The app uses a pre-trained **VGG19 CNN** to extract:
- **Content features** (deep layers of the network)  
- **Style features** (computed using Gram Matrices on shallow layers)  

3️⃣ An **optimization process** runs over multiple iterations (LBFGS optimizer):
- It minimizes **content loss** and **style loss** simultaneously  
- The target image is updated gradually to match both objectives  

4️⃣ Resulting image is displayed in the web UI for download.

## What I Learned

✅ How **Neural Style Transfer** works internally:

* Content loss based on deep CNN layer activations
* Style loss using **Gram Matrices**
* How optimization is used to generate a new image

✅ How to use **PyTorch** in practice:

* Load pre-trained networks (VGG19)
* Extract intermediate layer outputs
* Use **LBFGS optimizer** for image optimization

✅ How to build a complete **ML-powered Web App**:

* Expose ML models via **Flask API**
* Build simple **HTML UI**
* Handle image upload and result display

✅ Best practices:

* Separate model logic (`style_transfer.py`) from app logic (`app.py`)
* Automatically create necessary folders (uploads, results)
* How to scale such a project for cloud deployment (Heroku, Render)

## Possible Interview Questions & Answers

**Q1. What is Neural Style Transfer?**
👉 It is a deep learning technique that combines the content of one image with the style of another. It uses pre-trained CNNs to extract content and style features and optimizes an image to match both.

**Q2. How do you extract style information from an image?**
👉 Style is extracted using **Gram Matrices** computed from shallow CNN layers — these capture the texture and patterns of the image.

**Q3. What loss functions are used in Style Transfer?**
👉 Two main losses:

* **Content Loss**: MSE between content features of target and original content image
* **Style Loss**: MSE between Gram Matrices of target and style image

**Q4. Why is LBFGS optimizer used?**
👉 LBFGS is suitable for **optimization over image pixels** — it converges faster and more smoothly for this kind of problem.

**Q5. How would you deploy this app in production?**
👉 Package the app in Docker, deploy Flask app on Render or Heroku, use a GPU instance if higher performance is required.
